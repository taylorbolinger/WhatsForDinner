Broken stuff: 
1.
this is a spelling or something problem: 
    ENTRY_TYPE_CHOICES = [
        ('home_entree', 'Home Entree'),
        ('restaurant', 'Restaurant'),
        ('delivery_option', 'Delivery Option'),
    ]
    entry_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=ENTRY_TYPE_CHOICES)
2. 
If a person isn't in a family, they can add dinner options, which doesn't make sense b/c the options should be designated for a family
3. 
plural/singular is wrong on some data models/views/pages or not consistent.  

if you want to start over with models, then delete files in migrations folder, except init py
